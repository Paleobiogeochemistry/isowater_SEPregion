This repository aim to storage the python scripts and data set used for the paper titled Isotopic characterization of water masses in the Eastern South Pacific Ocean: Paleoceanography implications 

**The paper is available in (xxWebpageofthejournalxx when will be published) 
**The data set is available in (xxpangaeaxx)

# Motivation and scientific goals 

This study aim to hydrologically characterized the water masses of the Southeast Pacific (SEP), going from surface (Subtropical Water, STW and Subantarctic Water, SAAW), to subsurface (Equatorial Subsurface Water, ESSW), intermediate (Antarctic Intermediate Water, AAIW) and finally deep waters (Pacific Deep Water, PDW).
To achieve this we use seawater oxygen, deuterium, dissolved inorganic carbon isotopes in combination with temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrient concentrations along a coastal (71-78 °W) and an oceanic (82-98 °W) transect in the Eastern South Pacific. 
The data set integrate published and new measurements collected between 1992 and 2018. We hope that the data base, the scripts and the manuscript can promote the idea of use oceanographic data near to the sediment core sites for have accurate modern-analogs to impruve the interpretation of past changes in water mass chemistry and geometry in the Eastern South Pacific. This is relevat specially in coastal zones where continental process are conected with oceanographic processes and all together is passing to the fosil record. 
As a group we are continue sampling sea water in the region for stable isotopes analysis with the goals i) impruve the cover of data ii) understand temporal variation of the stable isotope signatures of water masses iii) integrate oceanographic data to understand changes of the tracers in long-term scales. 

## Target group for apply python code 

The python code that is storage in this project is specific and only work for users that want to compare oceanographic parameters between coastal (71-78 °W) and an oceanic sections (82-98 °W) in the Eastern South Pacific. With minor modifications of the code can be applicable for any oceanographic zone of the Earth in any data cloud. 

## Prerequisites

- Instal python 3 
- Instal python libraries (downloand the following archive to check if you have all the necesary libraries that will be necesary for run the code in your PC)
- Hydrological data set organize with the following format
